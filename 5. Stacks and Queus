Simple data structures that store objects either in first-in-first-out or last-in-last-out

Stacks

data structure that where items are added and removed in last-in-first-out-order. LIFO "life-oh"
Similar to a stack of books on a desk
sometimes called a `pushdown-stack`
Push() to add 
Pop() to remove

------------
Linked-List Stacks
pushing a value into a linked list stack

Push(Cell: sentinel, Data:new_value)
//Make a cell to hold new new_value
Cell: new_cell = New Cell 
new_cell.Value = new_value

//Add new cell to linked List
new_cell.Next = sentinel.Next
sentinel.Next = new_cell 
end Push
