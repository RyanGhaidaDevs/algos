//write a function that accepts two parameters; one being a non-empty string of letters and the second being a key of an integer value.
//the key value should represent how many values each letter should shift by.
//for example 'abc', 2 => 'cde'


//initially I was thinking to make a LL of all the alphabet letters
// Having the LL be one giant loop in which z -> a
//creating a traverse method for the LL and just having that initiate a loop that will iterate the pointers for each letter by the set amount of the key.
