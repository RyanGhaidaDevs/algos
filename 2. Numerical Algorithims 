Numerical integration ( numeric quadrature) is the process of using numerical techniques to approxiamte the area under a curve defined by a function. 


Even if you cant find the functions anti-derivative and cant neccesarily use Calculus to approximate area, you can still use numerical intergration. 

Namely, Newton-Cotes formulas: retangle rule, trapezoid rule. 

-------------
Rectangle Rule 

uses a series of rectangles w/ uniform width to approximate the are under a curve. 

Trapezoid Rule 

Used to make a better estimation than what the rectangle rule can give us. 
-------------- 
Adaptive quadrature

in which the program detects areas where its approximation methods may produce large erros and refines its method in those areas.

--------------
Monte Carlo Integration 

a form of numeric integration in which a program genreates a series of pseudorandom points unifomrly within the area and determines whether each point lies within the target region
--------------
Finding Zeros 

given a function y =f(x) when we find x where y = 0 aka crosses x-axis, this is called the 'root'
