Linked list is built of objects that are often called cells. These cells contains whatever data the list must store plus a link to another cell. 
The link is simply a refrence or pointer to another object of a cell's class. Often the pointer field in the cell class is called Next. 

------------
Singly Linked Lists 

each cell is connected to the following cell by a single link. 

To use a linked list, you need a set of algorithims for:
- iterating over a list 
- finding items in the list 
- removing items 
- adding items 

What is a sentinel? 

A sentinel is a cell that is part of the linked list but that doesn't contain any meaningfull data. It is only used as a placeholder so that algorithims can refer to a cell that comes before the first cell. 
-------------
Adding cells to the beggining 

place a new_cell at the beggining right after the sentinel.

set the new_cell's Next pointer so that it points to the first cell in the list after the sentinel. 
then set the sentinel's Next pointer to the new_cell 

O(1)
-------------
Adding cell at the end

travese entire linked_list untill Top points to nil (aka end of list)
make the last cell's link point to the new_cell and then sets the new_cells link to point to null 

O(N)
--------------
Inserting cells after other cells
