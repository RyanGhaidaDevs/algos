Chapter 1: Algorithim Basics 

Algorithim defiens the steps for performing a task in a certain way. 

Appraoch and things to keep in considertation: 
  -   Behavior
  -   Speed
  -   Memory Requirements
  -   Techniques utilized 

Data type of a list is similar to a self-expanding array, unlike arrays, lists allow you to add and remove items from any position. 

A good algorithim must have three features: correctness, maintainability, efficiency. 

-----------
Big O notation: 

a function to describe how the alogorithim's worst-case-performance relates to the problem as the problem size as the size approaches infinity. 
This is know as a programs ASYMPTOTIC PERFORMACE 
O(N^2) is pronounced "O of N squared"
